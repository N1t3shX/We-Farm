# Crop Price Prediction System - Project Documentation

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for an agricultural crop price prediction application built using modern web technologies and machine learning algorithms.

## Development Environment Setup

You have multiple options for working with this codebase, depending on your preferred workflow and development tools.

### Option 1: Lovable Platform Integration

Access the project through the Lovable development environment by navigating to your project dashboard. Any modifications you make through the Lovable interface will be automatically synchronized with this repository, ensuring seamless version control integration.

### Option 2: Local Development Setup

For developers who prefer working in their own integrated development environment, you can set up the project locally on your machine. This approach gives you full control over your development workflow while maintaining synchronization with the remote repository.

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js runtime environment (version 14 or higher recommended)
- npm package manager (comes bundled with Node.js)
- Git version control system

**Installation Instructions:**

If you don't have Node.js installed, you can use Node Version Manager (nvm) for easy installation and version management. Refer to the official nvm documentation for installation steps.

**Getting Started Locally:**

Execute the following commands in your terminal to set up the development environment:

```bash
# Retrieve the project repository from the remote source
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Change into the project root directory
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Download and install all required project dependencies
npm i

# Launch the local development server with hot-reload capabilities
npm run dev
```

The development server will start and provide you with a local preview URL where you can view your application in real-time.

### Option 3: GitHub Web Interface

You can make direct edits to files through GitHub's web-based editor:

- Open the file you wish to modify in the GitHub repository view
- Locate and click the edit icon (typically displayed as a pencil symbol) in the file header
- Make your desired changes in the web editor
- Save your changes by committing them with an appropriate commit message

### Option 4: GitHub Codespaces

For a cloud-based development experience without local setup:

- Go to your repository's main page on GitHub
- Find and click the green "Code" button located in the top-right area of the page
- Open the "Codespaces" section from the dropdown menu
- Initialize a new Codespace instance by clicking "New codespace"
- Once the environment is ready, you can edit files directly in the browser
- Commit and push your changes when you're satisfied with your modifications

## Technology Stack

The application leverages the following technologies and frameworks:

- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server for modern web applications
- **TypeScript**: Typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code reliability
- **React**: Popular JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces
- **shadcn-ui**: Collection of reusable UI components built on Radix UI
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development

## Deployment Process

To make your application publicly accessible, you can deploy it through the Lovable platform:

1. Access your project in the Lovable dashboard
2. Navigate to the Share menu
3. Select the Publish option to deploy your application

## Custom Domain Configuration
